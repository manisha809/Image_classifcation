# Image_classifcation
The following steps will be involved in this project:
Choose a dataset. The first step is to choose a dataset for the image classification task. There are many public datasets available online, such as the CIFAR-10 dataset and the ImageNet dataset. These datasets contain a large number of images that have been labeled with their corresponding categories.
Prepare the dataset for training. Once a dataset has been chosen, it needs to be prepared for training. This involves resizing the images to a consistent size, converting the images to a format that can be processed by the CNN model, and assigning labels to the images.
Create training data and assign labels. The next step is to create training data for the CNN model. This involves dividing the dataset into two sets: a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the CNN model, while the test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
Define and train the CNN model. The next step is to define and train the CNN model. This involves creating a CNN architecture, choosing the hyperparameters for the model, and training the model on the training data.
Test the model's accuracy. Once the CNN model has been trained, it can be tested on the test set. This will give an indication of how well the model will perform on new, unseen images.
Deploy the model. Once the CNN model has been tested and verified, it can be deployed to a production environment. This will allow the model to be used to classify new, unseen images.
