# Image_classifcation
The project aims to develop an image classification system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system will accurately categorize images into different classes or categories.
The model will be trained on a large dataset and optimized to achieve high accuracy and robustness,
enabling it to perform reliable image classification tasks.
